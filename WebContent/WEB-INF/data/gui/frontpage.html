<b><h1>BOA - a framework for BOotstrapping the datA web.</h1></b><br/>
The idea behind BOA is to use the Data Web as background knowledge for the extraction of 
natural language patterns that represent predicates found on the Data Web. These patterns 
are used to extract instance knowledge from natural language text. This knowledge is 
finally fed back into the Data Web, therewith closing the loop. <br/><br/>
This is a first GUI version of BOA:\n
<ol><li>Select a corpus on the left side</li>
<li>Select a property in the tree</li>
<li>View the patterns</li>
<li>Click on a pattern to see the details!</li></ol>
